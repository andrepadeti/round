# Round English

This is the website for my ELT job. It's built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and styled with [Styled JSX](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx). The form uses [Formik](https://formik.org/) and [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup).

Illustrations come from [unDraw](https://undraw.co/).
